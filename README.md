# React Optimistic Toggle
React component to build Optimistic UIs.

If you see the 'FB or Twitter Like Button' or 'Add To Favorite' button in many websites you'll notice that when you click on the button it instantly shows that you have liked it. It then sends a request, if the request succeeds then the post stays liked otherwise it reverts back to unliked state. This is called Optimistic UI update.

`react-optimistic-toggle` helps you build these kind of UI effortlessly.
